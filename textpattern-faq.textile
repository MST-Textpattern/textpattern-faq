You can fetch the latest development source of Textpattern with "Subversion":http://textpattern.com/faq/275/subversion (SVN). There are "various SVN clients":http://google.com/search?q=svn+client available, for multiple platforms. Tutorials for a couple popular choices can be found in "Textpattern Documentation":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Designer_and_Developer_Interests.

What follows is a quick style guide, to be followed when modifying Textpattern source files to make patches for submission.

h2. Patch Style Guide

# Use UNIX (LF) line feeds/endings rather than Windows (CR+LF) or Mac (CR) ^[1]^
# Use &quot;Real&quot; or actual tabs, rather than spaces ^[1]^
# When naming your patch file, make the name descriptive, and include the current revision number. e.g. fix_category_bug_r1375.patch
# Create "a new issue":http://code.google.com/p/textpattern/issues/entry?template=User%20enhancement%20request. Describe what your patch is for. Attach it, if possible, to your issue. If you're unable to do so, upload it somewhere where it can be downloaded, and include a full url to the file. ^2^

h3. Notes

[1] Every decent text editor should allow you to change your line feed and tab settings, as well as what you want your defaults for these two settings to be.
[2] Patches can also be sent in to the public "developers' mailing list":http://lists.textpattern.com/mailman/listinfo/txp-dev.
